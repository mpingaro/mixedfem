\section{PEERSQ element}
In this section we define the element derived by the PEERS with different enrichment of bubble functions. 

\subsection{PEERSQ: one bubble function}
In the following we refer as \textbf{PEERS1B} for this element.


\subsection{PEERSQ: two bubble functions}
We define two types of element with two bubble functions: one using two standard bubbles (\textbf{PEERSQ2B}) and the second with a standard bubble plus a mixed bubble function (\textbf{PEERSQ2BM}).

\subsection{PEERSQ: three bubbles}
This element are defined in the \cite{Morley} and its the first enrichments used.
