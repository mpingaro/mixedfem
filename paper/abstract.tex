We present an analysis of the extension of the lower order $PEERS$ element for the quadrilateral element. 
The approach is based on a modification of the Hellingerâ€“Reissner functional in which the symmetry of the stress field is enforced weakly through the introduction of a Lagrange multiplier.
It uses the lowest order $RT_{0}$ space for the stress, and piecewise constants for the displacement and bilinear for the rotation.
We focus the attention of the different enrichment of stress field using different choise of bubble functions.
In the case of no optimal convergence we correct the spaces of approximations as in such a way of $ABF$.
More examples are developed to study the capacity of the different element in the case of the regular meshes such as in the distorted meshes.  

%We present an extension of the PEERS element for the quadrilateral element for the linear elasticity problems.
